Any ideas that you have for the project have here
Machine Learning
Linear regression using all of the columns we can find - ei 5 year trend, mortality rate
MUA
Income Level
Types of Cancer
Review historical trends (over 5/10/15 year period) for mortality / incidents by demographic 
Dashboard (Columns)

Database
Webscraping Population/ incident for https://www.statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/
Webscraping mortality for https://www.statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/
Webscraping Medically underserved area value/ median income/ Rural/Non-Rural/MUA index level for https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/mua-find
Presentation slide break down
1: Title: Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Medically Underserved Areas
2: Questions [Dashboard tabs]
Is there a relationship between Cancer Mortality and the medically underserved index?
Is there a relationship between Demographic data and Cancer Incidence or Mortality?
If there is a relationship between Cancer Mortality and median household income act as a significant factor in this relationship? 
3: Visualizations/Background/Motivation
